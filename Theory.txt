Multithreaded Sorting

Sorting is a fundamental problem. A multithreaded sorting algorithm leverages concurrency by dividing an array into parts, sorting each part in parallel threads, and then merging them.

Why Multithreading?

Traditional sorting is sequential â†’ O(n log n).

Using threads, multiple cores can work simultaneously.

Improves performance on large datasets.

Demonstrates OS concepts like thread creation, synchronization, and merging results.

Approach:

Divide: Split the array into T parts (T = number of threads).

Sort: Each thread sorts its chunk (e.g., using quicksort/merge sort).

Merge: Combine the sorted chunks into the final sorted array.

This is basically a parallel version of Merge Sort.
